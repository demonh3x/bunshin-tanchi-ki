Testing
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Unify interface testing. Same test for all the classes implementing an interface


Core
-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Implement HashUniquesExporter
Multiple HashCalculators to use one OR another to detect a duplicate
# !! Parse logical columns on CSV
# !! HashUniquesScanner handle Column Mappings
    # -> new FilteredRandomReader($RandomReader, new ColumnMapperRowFilter($mapping)) does the job.
# !! FilteredRandomReader test
MySQL Random reader
MySQL Writer
- XLS Random reader
# CsvColumnWriter

Refactor FirstName and Surname Filter

# Documentation Random Reader
#!! Clean output data (Applying filters to exit)
#!! OccurrencesScanner (Capital letters detector -> Regex)
#!! PurlGenerator - PURL Combinations (Jamie)
#! Bugs: Pound symbol and null values on 32/Field 5
#!! First Name Filter (Filter Composite Names (ex: MacDow))
#!! Surname Filter

# Handling empty salutation when generating PURLs
# Refactor PurlCalculators
Refactor PURL-Number behaviour to generate infinite combinations

# HashUniquesScanner depend on UniquesList instead of HashList
# HashUniquesExporter construct with HashCalculator and UniquesList as HashUniquesScanner
# Unify the usage of the scanners (maybe an interface for scanners?) -> HashUniquesExporter extends HashUniquesScanner

# Remove Readers because they are not used.
# Refactor RandomReader to move the open($path) method to the constructor and remove isReady().
    # The constructor should throw an exception if it is not ready when creating.
# Refactor Writer interface to move the create($path) method to the constructor and remove isReady().
    # The constructor should throw an exception if it is not ready when creating.

# Refactor Row class to have HashCalculator on the constructor
# Refactor RowListener to send as parameters: RandomReader, $index, $hash. Instead of Row object.
# Refactor HashUniquesScanner to have Array(RandomReader) and DuplicatesListener in the constructor.
# Refactor CsvColumnRandomReader to be a child class from CsvRandomReader.
# Refactor StringHashCalculator to be inmutable: Move watchColumns() and setFilter() in the constructor.
# Extract RowFilter functionality outside StringHashCalculator

# Refactor FilterGroup

! Remove functionality from UI, move it to core.
    Merge data to uniques data
    What do I do with merged data? delete? move?
    When generating fields -> What do I do with original data? delete? move?

!!! Not re-de-duping duplicates groups from previous batches. Or data from already de-duped database...
# !!! encripting/decoding writer/reader

Make UniquePURLGenerator faster by pointing at last calculator used

UI
-----------------------------------------------------------------
# UI
# Unique PURLs
# List of results and link to the page for editing dups group
# Page to upload file, configure Scanner
# Configure PURL Column
# Append saving dups group to uniques
# Warnings when edditing a group of more than 2 rows
~# Fatal error (manually thrown) when writing the dupsGroups to the uniques file more than once at a time.

# Download link duplicates groups
# Generate Fields links in duplicates groups using the UniquePURLGenerator
    #- create generated file in the same folder as original
    #- move original file to beforeGenerating folder

# In dedup page, show the number of rows of every dups group.
# In dedup page, show the number of rows of uniques file and input files.

#! Column specific filters
Page for using OcurrenceScanner (similar to HashUniquesScanner)

#!! Cleaning Filters

# Auto-select the PURL column in editGroup page to the Identifying column selected when scanning.
# Option to deactivate PURL checking
#! Try filters before applying them on the scanner.

# Bug when checking all rows in editDupsGroup with the upper-left checkbox. It'll save an additional empty row.
# Bug when only checking the first row in editDupsGroup.

# Fix multiple "../deduplications/" appendings when redirecting.

# Add input files to a dedup work

Merge all group of duplicates link

Write Logs
Option to deactivate duplicate groups writing

#!! generateFields customize $purlColumn  $firstNameColumn = "3"; lastNameColumn = "4"; $salutationColumn = "2";

Sending empty input files when creating work, crashes
